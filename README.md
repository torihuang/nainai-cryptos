# NaiNai Cryptos

The purpose of this app is to provide real-time information for my NaiNai (Chinese for grandmother) as she decides whether or not to trade her BTC. The app utilizes React, Redux, SASS, and ties in to cryptocompare's API.

## Getting Started
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Next Steps
1. Refactor Redux methods so that altcoin type is not hardcoded
2. I am new to Redux, so I am sure there are many other things to improve!
